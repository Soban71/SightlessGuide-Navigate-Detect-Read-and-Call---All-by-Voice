**SightlessGuide: Navigate, Detect, Read and Call-All by Voice**  
**Final Year Project**

**Overview**

SightlessGuide is a comprehensive Android application designed to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals. Leveraging advanced technologies like YOLO v8, ResNet50, and various voice recognition modules, the app provides real-time object detection, currency recognition, navigation, weather updates, and text scanning capabilities, all controlled through voice commands.

**Features**

**Real-time Object Detection**
Technology Used: YOLO v8
Dataset: Open Image V7
Functionality: Continuously captures images to identify and describe objects in real-time, providing auditory feedback to the user.


**Real-time Currency Detection**
Technology Used: ResNet50 model
Functionality: Recognizes and describes different currency notes, providing details via voice.


**Real-time Navigation**
Functionality: Provides route guidance from source to destination based on voice input. The app automatically retrieves the user's current location when the navigation module is activated.
Voice Control: Allows users to set destinations and receive real-time route guidance and alerts through voice commands.'


**Weather Updates**
Functionality: Retrieves and analyzes current weather data based on the user's location, delivering weather reports and suggestions via voice.
Text Scanner
Functionality: Activated by double-tapping, this feature captures images of text, analyzes and extracts the text, then converts it to speech and reads it aloud.


**Emergency Contacts**
Registration: Facilitators register emergency contacts during the initial registration process.
Voice Calling: Users can call emergency contacts by name using voice commands.


**Voice Command Control**
Module Switching: Users can switch between modules (object detection, navigation, weather, etc.) using voice commands.
Automatic Location Retrieval: The app automatically retrieves the user's current location when the navigation module is activated.
